HALFTONE CMYK — Desktop Launcher Package

What this gives you:
- Launch Halftone CMYK.bat  (double-click this)
- setup_env.bat             (installs Python deps)
- run_app.bat               (runs app)
- .command files for mac included (if present)

Windows use:
1) Double-click "Launch Halftone CMYK.bat"
2) First run may install dependencies, then app opens.

macOS use (from this same project copy):
- You cannot build a native .app on Windows.
- On Mac, use run_app.command (double-click) after allowing permissions.
- If blocked, right-click > Open.

For a real Mac double-click .app with no warnings, it must be built/signed/notarized on a Mac.
